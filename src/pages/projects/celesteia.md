_Made using C# with the MonoGame framework._

A 2D sandbox game featuring procedural world generation and resource management systems, presented as my final high school project. The method of managing the project has changed the teaching methods of computer science at the school, acting as an approachable project management method. This project won the school's award for Best Project in the Sciences.
