Hiya,

Over the past few months I've been getting a lot of questions about my name, then I saw one of my co-workers pull up my GitHub which had Hazel plastered all 
over it. So here's the deal.

A few months back I went through some revelations about my identity, who I truly wanted to be. I was already transitioning from male to female, and already
had my legal name and gender changed to accommodate it, keeping my first name, Morgan.

I ended up finding out after some experimentation within friend groups that I found the name Hazel a lot more fitting personally. In the end, I don't really
care all too much what you end up calling me, it's also very unlikely that I'd go through the process of changing it legally. I just have a preference for 
Hazel as a calling name ('roepnaam' in Dutch).
            
Sincerely, Morgan/Hazel
